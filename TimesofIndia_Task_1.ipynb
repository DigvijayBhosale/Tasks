       "['One look at college campuses in the city and you will see a lot of students along with their two-wheelers in the parking lot. For them, their ride is more than just a way to commute to college. While there are many who prefer to own the latest model that guarantees them speed and thrill, there are also some, who prefer to go the classic way. We spoke to a few students about their bikes…\\nIt’s all about durability and strength\\nFor many students, owning a classic (in some cases vintage bike) is more than just the looks. “I have always preferred a two-stroke bike. Once the two-stroke bikes were out and the four-stroke ones were introduced, I felt that it killed the automobile industry. So, in a bid to revive the two-stroke bike, I got myself a Java,” says Joel AJ, a 23-year-old sound engineering student, who owns a 1973 Java.\\n\\nSimilarly, Gaurav Darshan, a 20-year-old student from Jain University — CMS and a proud owner of Yamaha RD 350 1984, says that nothing beats the thrill of having a classic bike like his. “To own a classic bike like the Yamaha RD 350 1984 is a different feeling all together. My bike was imported from Japan and is a rare bike. Not many in Bengaluru own it,” he says, adding, “One of the advantages of this bike is that the engine cools down really fast. Also, unlike the newer bikes, this is a lot stronger and tougher. It is built in such a way that it can take on a lot of strain and still work fine.”\\nJoel says the reason why a lot of youngsters vouch for these bikes these days is because the older bikes are a lot stronger compared to the latest ones in the market.\\nZero maintenance but finding bike parts is a task\\nHow easy or difficult is it to maintain these bikes, we ask? Students says that if one rides these bikes like they are supposed to and get them serviced on a regular basis, then these bikes are almost zero maintenance. “It is easy to maintain these bikes. If you look at the newer bikes, when a small part needs to be replaced, the entire thing is changed. That is not the case with such classic bikes. I hardly spend around `4,000-5,000 every 6-7 months on maintenance,” says Joel. Brian Shaji, an 18-year-old student from St. Joseph’s College of Art and Science, who has a 2002 Electra 350, agrees and says, “If in the right hands, these bikes will incur very less expenses.”\\n\\n\\nHowever, when it comes to sourcing bike parts, it is almost impossible to get their hands on original parts, say these bike enthusiasts. “Sometimes, we have to get the bike parts from Mysuru or Coimbatore,” says Suresh Kumar DC, a 23-year-old student from Jain University-CMS, who owns a Yezdi Roadking 1995. But quality is something they are not willing to compromise on. “Sometimes, it takes me two years to find the right bike parts for my two-wheeler. Often, when we look online, we come across duplicate parts, which are not good. It will ruin your bike if you use duplicate parts. But if you have original parts in your bike, maintenance and service is extremely easy,” says Gaurav. They add that some of these bike parts are not available in India and have to be sourced from outside the country.\\n\\n\\nAn emotional attachment to the bikes\\n\\nThese bike lovers say that their bike is more than just a piece of machine to them. “It is one thing to own a classic bike and another if you have assembled it on your own,” says Suresh. And when the bike has been handed down to you by your parents, it becomes all the more special. “My bike was handed down to me by my father. I have sat on that bike on the first and last day of my school. After I joined college, my dad gave me the keys to the bike,” says Brian. Some of these students treat their bike like an individual and have even named it. “I have named my bike Dada. I was, in some way, inspired by Vijay Devarakonda, who rides a similar bike in one of his films. He had named his bike Dada, so I thought why not name my bike Dada too,” says Suresh. Similarly, Brian and Joel too have named their bikes Faith and Meghan respectively.\\n\\n\\nStudents add that the admiration they get for owning these bikes is a different high. “It feels so good when you are riding your bike and people notice. I have had a lot of people come to me and ask me questions about the bike. Sometimes people even ask me if am willing to sell it,” says Gaurav, adding that he will never trade his Yamaha RD 350 1984 for anything in the world. Joel says that some of these bikes have to be earned. “It is not easy to ride a 1973 Java. So, when people see you riding one, it means that you have earned that bike and they always come up to me and admire my bike and have respect for me. The reactions I get are just awesome,” Joel sums up.',\n",

It was no different with namma Gurukiran, who met his teenage icon Kumar Gaurav over the weekend in Goa. “We have common friends and when he told me that Kumar Gaurav would also be at this party we were set to attend, my joy knew no bounds,” shares an elated Guru. “In fact, I started my career by singing his songs. The very first number I sang was Yeh Zamin Gaa Rahi Hai, which was a rage then. I told him I treated him like god the minute I met him,” adds the acclaimed music director. “We chatted for a long time and I asked him for an autograph, which is something I haven’t done till now,” he adds. The highlight? “When I gave Kumar Gaurav my autograph at the end of our meeting,” smiles Guru.',\n",

       " 'Friendship Day is an occasion that everyone might have looked forward to in their younger days, be it in school or college. It is during the day that girls and boys exchanged colourful friendship bands and greeting cards. But has that excitement died down with this tech-savvy generation? We talk to a few students about their thoughts on Friendship Day, which is on August 5, and how they celebrate it.\\nWriting letters will be unique in today’s time: Priya George, St Teresa’s College, Kochi\\nJust like Valentine’s Day and a few others, I think friendship too should not be reduced to celebrating it only on a particular day. But, if you do it, the best way would be to organise get-togethers, have sumptuous food and above all, spend quality time with friends. In our daily lives, we take our friends’ help in every step, and this day can be better used to express what they mean to us. On a personal note, I would like to write letters to my best friend because that has become so rare these days and it would definitely be treasured. Through the letter, keeping in mind the umpteen things she has done for me, I would thank her for being there for me and acknowledge all her efforts to help me.\\n\\nRemembering old friends will make them feel special: Ridhiya Carol Paramel, Rajagiri Centre for Business Studies, Kochi\\nRather than giving greeting cards or tying a friendship band on Friendship Day, I would prefer to spend quality time with my friends. I also feel that it’s important to walk down memory lane and remember the good companions from each phase of our lives, from high school to college. It’s good to reminisce about those friends who have not been in touch with you, by wishing them and telling them how you still cherish each of them for their kind gestures. This would be the best way to celebrate Friendship Day in all its essence and could also pave way to rekindle old relationships. If you do not wish or give gifts to your current friends, it might not matter to them as long as you are always with them. But when you put such an effort for your long-lost friends, it makes them feel really special and triggers a lot of positivity.\\n\\nMost youngsters find it absurd to celebrate friendship just for A day: PJ Sam Alex, University of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram\\nIn my opinion, the concept of Friendship Day has been an extension of the popular culture. In this era of technology, friendships like any social relationship have become more fragile, and yet people seem to enjoy warm friendships in colleges. While social media has narrowed the gap between friends living in different places, it has increased the distance between those nearby. Unfortunately, we fail to connect with those who are near us and that is the biggest letdown of social media. When compared to the insightful discourses in the past, the discussions now are a lot different, but it has also become more straightforward. Male-female friendships have been evolving because of which we have been able to openly talk about issues that we face. As for celebrating Friendship Day, many youngsters feel that it is really absurd to observe companionship and bonding for just a day. They value their friendships and let their peers know that as well.\\n\\nThis friendship day, I will fondly and proudly remember Abhimanyu for the friend he was: Jibin Payyannur, Maharaja’s College, Kochi\\nThough the intensity of friendships remains the same, how the bonds are formed has changed. Given that the academic year of most students is so tightly packed, in order to foster camaraderie, we have to rely to social media to a great extent. Friendship bands and greeting cards are no longer seen as something you must exchange. Now, feelings are expressed more in the form of status, story and video on social networking platforms. As the saying goes, sadness and happiness are on the same plane and sharing both plays a crucial role in human relationships. It is the same for friendships too. The more you share sadness, the less gloomy you will be and the more you share happiness, the more joyous you become. This Friendship Day, I will fondly and proudly remember Abhimanyu, who left the world at such an early age. Though there has always been skirmishes within the college, it never lasted long. When he died, everyone was deeply affected, and we are still struggling to come to terms with what happened. Despite him being in the college for only a year, the magnitude of people who grieved for him is proof of the good friend he was and the hearts he had touched. What makes him worth remembering was how within a short span of time he was able to forge deep friendships. He can be called the epitome of friendship.',\n",

Similarly, Brian and Joel too have named their bikes Faith and Meghan respectively.\\nStudents add that the admiration they get for owning these bikes is a different high. “It feels so good when you are riding your bike and people notice. I have had a lot of people come to me and ask me questions about the bike. Sometimes people even ask me if am willing to sell it,” says Gaurav, adding that he will never trade his Yamaha RD 350 1984 for anything in the world. Joel says that some of these bikes have to be earned. “It is not easy to ride a 1973 Java. So, when people see you riding one, it means that you have earned that bike and they always come up to me and admire my bike and have respect for me. The reactions I get are just awesome,” Joel sums up.',\n",
       " 'So what if you are a big name in the film industry yourself? When you meet your childhood hero, you forget all else and the fan in you is what comes to the fore. It was no different with namma Gurukiran, who met his teenage icon Kumar Gaurav over the weekend in Goa. “We have common friends and when he told me that Kumar Gaurav would also be at this party we were set to attend, my joy knew no bounds,” shares an elated Guru. “In fact, I started my career by singing his songs. The very first number I sang was Yeh Zamin Gaa Rahi Hai, which was a rage then. I told him I treated him like god the minute I met him,” adds the acclaimed music director. “We chatted for a long time and I asked him for an autograph, which is something I haven’t done till now,” he adds. The highlight? “When I gave Kumar Gaurav my autograph at the end of our meeting,” smiles Guru.',\n",
       " 'It’s been a few weeks since the team of Boomerang, starring Atharvaa, Megha Akash and Induja, returned from Havelock Island,where they shot a song. But its director Kannan says that they are yet to get over the memories of being caught in a cyclone.\\n\\nRecounting the experience, he says, “We’d planned to shoot the song, Mugaiyaazhi, written by Vivek and composed by Radhan, for four days on a remote island near Havelock. Usually, a ferry comes from Port Blair to Havelock once in two days,and we’d made our own arrangements from there to reach the remote island. But as luck would have it, there was a cyclone alert on one of the days we were shooting.” Kannan says that since the sun rises at about 5am, he thought he could wrap up the shoot early on that day.“But the weather had become unpredictable and it started pouring like there’s no tomorrow. It was windy, and everything in the vicinity was getting blown away, including the tent that we’d pitched to take shelter! We got stranded on that island,”he says.\\n\\n\\nThings weren’t easy the next day either. “Because it had rained like crazy, the island, especially the forest area, had become slushy, and it was becoming difficult for the artistes to perform.But Brinda master beautifully managed to choreograph the sequences.It is one shoot that we aren’t going to forget in a long time,”he says.',\n",

       "['One look at college campuses in the city and you will see a lot of students along with their two-wheelers in the parking lot. For them, their ride is more than just a way to commute to college. While there are many who prefer to own the latest model that guarantees them speed and thrill, there are also some, who prefer to go the classic way. We spoke to a few students about their bikes…\\nIt’s all about durability and strength\\nFor many students, owning a classic (in some cases vintage bike) is more than just the looks. “I have always preferred a two-stroke bike. Once the two-stroke bikes were out and the four-stroke ones were introduced, I felt that it killed the automobile industry. So, in a bid to revive the two-stroke bike, I got myself a Java,” says Joel AJ, a 23-year-old sound engineering student, who owns a 1973 Java.\\n\\nSimilarly, Gaurav Darshan, a 20-year-old student from Jain University — CMS and a proud owner of Yamaha RD 350 1984, says that nothing beats the thrill of having a classic bike like his. “To own a classic bike like the Yamaha RD 350 1984 is a different feeling all together. My bike was imported from Japan and is a rare bike. Not many in Bengaluru own it,” he says, adding, “One of the advantages of this bike is that the engine cools down really fast. Also, unlike the newer bikes, this is a lot stronger and tougher. It is built in such a way that it can take on a lot of strain and still work fine.”\\nJoel says the reason why a lot of youngsters vouch for these bikes these days is because the older bikes are a lot stronger compared to the latest ones in the market.\\nZero maintenance but finding bike parts is a task\\nHow easy or difficult is it to maintain these bikes, we ask? Students says that if one rides these bikes like they are supposed to and get them serviced on a regular basis, then these bikes are almost zero maintenance. “It is easy to maintain these bikes. If you look at the newer bikes, when a small part needs to be replaced, the entire thing is changed. That is not the case with such classic bikes. I hardly spend around `4,000-5,000 every 6-7 months on maintenance,” says Joel. Brian Shaji, an 18-year-old student from St. Joseph’s College of Art and Science, who has a 2002 Electra 350, agrees and says, “If in the right hands, these bikes will incur very less expenses.”\\n\\n\\nHowever, when it comes to sourcing bike parts, it is almost impossible to get their hands on original parts, say these bike enthusiasts. “Sometimes, we have to get the bike parts from Mysuru or Coimbatore,” says Suresh Kumar DC, a 23-year-old student from Jain University-CMS, who owns a Yezdi Roadking 1995. But quality is something they are not willing to compromise on. “Sometimes, it takes me two years to find the right bike parts for my two-wheeler. Often, when we look online, we come across duplicate parts, which are not good. It will ruin your bike if you use duplicate parts. But if you have original parts in your bike, maintenance and service is extremely easy,” says Gaurav. They add that some of these bike parts are not available in India and have to be sourced from outside the country.\\n\\n\\nAn emotional attachment to the bikes\\n\\nThese bike lovers say that their bike is more than just a piece of machine to them. “It is one thing to own a classic bike and another if you have assembled it on your own,” says Suresh. And when the bike has been handed down to you by your parents, it becomes all the more special. “My bike was handed down to me by my father. I have sat on that bike on the first and last day of my school. After I joined college, my dad gave me the keys to the bike,” says Brian. Some of these students treat their bike like an individual and have even named it. “I have named my bike Dada. I was, in some way, inspired by Vijay Devarakonda, who rides a similar bike in one of his films. He had named his bike Dada, so I thought why not name my bike Dada too,” says Suresh. Similarly, Brian and Joel too have named their bikes Faith and Meghan respectively.\\n\\n\\nStudents add that the admiration they get for owning these bikes is a different high. “It feels so good when you are riding your bike and people notice. I have had a lot of people come to me and ask me questions about the bike.

       " 'One look at college campuses in the city and you will see a lot of students along with their two-wheelers in the parking lot. For them, their ride is more than just a way to commute to college. While there are many who prefer to own the latest model that guarantees them speed and thrill, there are also some, who prefer to go the classic way. We spoke to a few students about their bikes…\\nIt’s all about durability and strength\\nFor many students, owning a classic (in some cases vintage bike) is more than just the looks. “I have always preferred a two-stroke bike. Once the two-stroke bikes were out and the four-stroke ones were introduced, I felt that it killed the automobile industry. So, in a bid to revive the two-stroke bike, I got myself a Java,” says Joel AJ, a 23-year-old sound engineering student, who owns a 1973 Java.\\nSimilarly, Gaurav Darshan, a 20-year-old student from Jain University — CMS and a proud owner of Yamaha RD 350 1984, says that nothing beats the thrill of having a classic bike like his. “To own a classic bike like the Yamaha RD 350 1984 is a different feeling all together. My bike was imported from Japan and is a rare bike. Not many in Bengaluru own it,” he says, adding, “One of the advantages of this bike is that the engine cools down really fast. Also, unlike the newer bikes, this is a lot stronger and tougher. It is built in such a way that it can take on a lot of strain and still work fine.”\\nJoel says the reason why a lot of youngsters vouch for these bikes these days is because the older bikes are a lot stronger compared to the latest ones in the market.\\nZero maintenance but finding bike parts is a task\\nHow easy or difficult is it to maintain these bikes, we ask? Students says that if one rides these bikes like they are supposed to and get them serviced on a regular basis, then these bikes are almost zero maintenance. “It is easy to maintain these bikes. If you look at the newer bikes, when a small part needs to be replaced, the entire thing is changed. That is not the case with such classic bikes. I hardly spend around `4,000-5,000 every 6-7 months on maintenance,” says Joel. Brian Shaji, an 18-year-old student from St. Joseph’s College of Art and Science, who has a 2002 Electra 350, agrees and says, “If in the right hands, these bikes will incur very less expenses.”\\nHowever, when it comes to sourcing bike parts, it is almost impossible to get their hands on original parts, say these bike enthusiasts. “Sometimes, we have to get the bike parts from Mysuru or Coimbatore,” says Suresh Kumar DC, a 23-year-old student from Jain University-CMS, who owns a Yezdi Roadking 1995. But quality is something they are not willing to compromise on. “Sometimes, it takes me two years to find the right bike parts for my two-wheeler. Often, when we look online, we come across duplicate parts, which are not good. It will ruin your bike if you use duplicate parts. But if you have original parts in your bike, maintenance and service is extremely easy,” says Gaurav. They add that some of these bike parts are not available in India and have to be sourced from outside the country.\\nAn emotional attachment to the bikes\\nThese bike lovers say that their bike is more than just a piece of machine to them. “It is one thing to own a classic bike and another if you have assembled it on your own,” says Suresh. And when the bike has been handed down to you by your parents, it becomes all the more special. “My bike was handed down to me by my father. I have sat on that bike on the first and last day of my school. After I joined college, my dad gave me the keys to the bike,” says Brian. Some of these students treat their bike like an individual and have even named it. “I have named my bike Dada. I was, in some way, inspired by Vijay Devarakonda, who rides a similar bike in one of his films. He had named his bike Dada, so I thought why not name my bike Dada too,” says Suresh. Similarly, Brian and Joel too have named their bikes Faith and Meghan respectively.\\nStudents add that the admiration they get for owning these bikes is a different high. “It feels so good when you are riding your bike and people notice. I have had a lot of people come to me and ask me questions about the bike. Sometimes people even ask me if am willing to sell it,” says Gaurav, adding that he will never trade his Yamaha RD 350 1984 for anything in the world. Joel says that some of these bikes have to be earned. “It is not easy to ride a 1973 Java.

Usually, a ferry comes from Port Blair to Havelock once in two days,and we’d made our own arrangements from there to reach the remote island.

       " 'He was raised in a Kannadiga household in Kasaragodu, educated in Mangaluru and Australia, and worked in the US and Middle East, but the one thing that this former business analyst wanted to do was make at least one film. Senna Hegde got to do that with the 2016 Malayalam film 0-41*, which he made on a shoestring budget of `7 lakh. This is why he calls Katheyondu Shuruvagide — his first theatrical release — a bonus.\\nHow did this movie happen to you?\\nAmong those who liked the trailer of 0-41* were Anurag Kashyap and Rakshit Shetty. I was one of the script consultants on Ulidavaru Kandanthe, so Rakshit and I would keep exchanging ideas through the years. I was working abroad then, but returned in 2014 after my father passed away. I got to make my dream of making a film come true with 0-41*. After watching the trailer, Rakshit said that I had to make a Kannada film. When he heard the story of Katheyondu Shuruvagide, he loved it and said that he would produce it. I only had Diganth in mind for the lead and he was onboard 10 minutes into the narration. Pushkar (Mallikarujunaiah) came onboard soon after.\\n\\n\\nYou studied engineering and were a business analyst. How did films feature in the scheme of things? Since I was a child, the only thing that really interested me was movies. My goal was to make at least one movie in my lifetime. The other things that I did were just jobs, and it didn’t really matter if I didn’t do them the next day. But those jobs brought me to where I am today, so I can’t complain. Since I got to make a film with 0-41*, the chance to make Katheyondu Shuruvagide felt like a bonus.\\n\\nFACEBOOKTWITTERPINTREST\\n\\nThe film is set in a coastal area. Did your childhood influence that?\\n\\nThe coast was essential to me, because I grew up there. When I was writing the script of Katheyondu Shuruvagide, it seemed natural for me to base the story in coastal areas. There are a lot of real-life inspirations in the film — either mine or my friends. The main character runs a resort, so I had a choice of either basing it in the mountains or by the beach, and I’m always drawn to the beach.\\n\\n\\nThis is a conversational film. Where did that idea come from?\\n\\nI adore the kind of films that Richard Linklater Cameron Crowe make, because they are character-driven and conversational. I initially wanted to make Katheyondu Shuruvagide between two characters — a conversation between two strangers, meeting in an odd place, both lost souls, whose conversations develop into meaningful relationships. I later added other characters to add joy, humour and other emotions to the journey of the two main characters.\\n\\n\\nYou set out to make one movie, now you’ve made two. What’s next?\\n\\nI’m quite lazy, so for me, it’s only one movie at a time. I believe that a director is only as good as his last film. So, if Katheyondu Shuruvagide works, a few more opportunities will come along; if not, then it’s back to square one, and I will see what needs to be done. I’m content with my life, and I know that regardless of how my films fare, my dog will still come up to me and lick me the next day (laughs).',\n",

It is to be utilized for financial viability by the bidder, who will execute the Metro project on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model for the first phase.\\nPMRDA metropolitan commissioner Kiran Gitte said the land can be utilised by the bidder to generate funds to operate the first phase of the project. “As the project is being executed as per PPP model, the final bidder will be decided this week,” he added.\\nThree companies have been shortlisted so far, including Tata Realty Siemens, IRB in consortium with Chinese and Malaysian companies and ILFS. The successful bidder will have to bring in 60% funding for the project, including 30% in equity and 70% in debt.\\nThe Union government had earlier agreed in principle to provide 20% viability gap funding for the same line, while the state government had agreed to give land for monetizing the project.\\nThe cabinet note has stated that the land will be handed over to the bidder for a 35-year lease period and the allocation will speed up the Metro project. The final bidder is being decided by the PMRDA. The bidder who will quote less viability gap funding from the government would bag the contract.\\nIt is a single tender and all the Metro works, including construction of stations, setting up of signals and wagons, are to be managed by the contractor. The commission period of the project would be three years, following which the contractor will run the Metro for 35 years.\\nBesides this land in Balewadi, the PMRDA will provide another 50 acres of land for the car shed of the project.

       " \"If you struggle to achieve something for 17 years, you don’t let go of that thing easily when you get it. This is what 'Mukkabaaz' actor Vineet Kumar Singh’s journey in Bollywood teaches us. Singh, who plays Imtiaz Shah in Reema Kagti’s upcoming sports film 'Gold', had a seriously swollen leg, on the day he joined the shoot. However, fearing that the shoot would be stopped or he would be replaced, he continued filming, including the physically tacing hockey sequences, hiding his swollen leg under plasters. He reveals, “When I heard the script of 'Gold', I knew in my heart that for this one role, I would readily miss five other films.” Vineet started shooting for Gold merely two days after wrapping up 'Mukkabaaz'. “My ankle had swollen to double its size. But I hid that because I was coming in from a film where I had shot physically taxing scenes under severe pain. I had trained for pain, so I could deal with it,” he says. Vineet would hide his injury under a thick plaster and a sock on which he would wear his shin guards and join the other cast members for the shoot. However, his fear of getting replaced was short-lived. He explains, “When Reema found out about my injury, she was surprised. She told me I should have revealed my injury on the first day. Since I am a hockey player, she knew I was perfectly cast and there was no chance that she would have replaced me. She asked me to rest, but I would still report to sets and be a part of the process.”\",\n",

Director-writer Milap Milan Zaveri, who conceptualised these sequences, also spent more than half of the film’s schedule, shooting these challenging scenes.\\n\\nTalking about the power-packed sequences, Milap says, “Action that stems from emotions always strikes a chord with the audience. We were sure that all the sequences will have to be backed by emotions. We didn’t want stylised action, which looks slick, but lacks that power. We wanted the sequences to look raw and have a sense of newness. It was Nikkhil (producer Nikkhil Advani), who came up with the suggestion that we should show John tearing a tyre apart. It symbolises a man breaking out of the shackles of corruption.”\\n\\n\\nIn the film, John plays a vigilante, who has a strong reason to fight the ills of society. While the actor has performed action scenes in recent times, the sequences here are more extreme in nature. Says Milap, “John is the Indian Hulk. Yes, he has done realistic action in his recent films, but in 'Satyameva Jayate', the kind of action that he has pulled off will make the audience want to clap, whistle and cheer for him.” He adds, “The action in this film draws its energy from emotions. John lives up to the moniker, Action Abraham. When he uproots the door of a vehicle, he looks convincing because he’s so physically fit.

       " \"We have heard of overnight replacements on TV shows, but in an unprecedented development, an on-the-spot replacement has taken place on 'Udann'. With the show all set to go in for a seven-year leap, the makers decided to rope in a popular face, who could take the story forward as Suraj’s (Vijayendra Kumeria) brother, Ghumaan Singh. After considering several names, the competition boiled down to Krrip Kapur Suri and Mohammad Nazim.\\n\\nThe makers finalised Krrip, who was asked to report on the set and commence the shoot the same day. However, just as he entered Film City and was approaching the set, he was informed that he is no longer a part of the project and his rival (Nazim) has been signed on.\\n\\n\\nA rather shocked Krrip spoke to BT about what ensued after he was confirmed on the show. He said, “No one should ever hurt anyone’s emotions, especially an actor’s, because emotions are all he has got, and he portrays them on screen. I was at the Film City gate, when I learnt that another actor (Nazim) has been roped in for the part. It was both surprising and shocking. However, I am happy for Nazim, as I am sure that like me, he, too, needs work and money. My only concern is that such incidents shouldn’t take place, as there are many aspiring and new actors, who could feel dejected and shaken. I don’t know what would have happened if I had reached the set. All I can say is that it’s not an insult to my acting, but to the judgement of those who replaced me after roping me in. It’s an insult to their discretion and decision. I have learnt that you don’t become an actor just by learning the craft, it’s situations likes these that make you a good artiste. Life is the biggest guru and circumstances teach you what the most reputed schools can’t do.”\\n\\nMeanwhile...\\n\\nMohammad Nazim, who has bagged the part, has no clue about the last-minute replacement. He says, “I was unaware of Krrip’s replacement, but this is a competitive industry and we are here to work hard and create our own space. I am currently focussing on my work.” This is for the first time that the doting son Ahem on 'Saath Nibhaana Saathiya' will turn negative on screen. He says, “I have never thought of playing a negative role, but when I was offered 'Udann', I felt that it would be fun. Besides, the character had to be different from my previous outing, especially because I am returning to daily soaps after almost a year.”\",\n",

       " 'If you ask TV show makers the recipe of a hit Indian soap, they would say, “All you need is a a sweet heroine, a spunky hero and a big joint family. You stir them together for a while and then add a vampy tadka. And voila, your show is ready!” The vamps of Indian television are the special tadka that one needs to dish out a hit. Today’s vamps have overgrown the era of oversized bindis and jarring background scores (remember Komolika’s nikaa?). No-less evil, they are now a lot more subtle and, most importantly, social media savvy. Despite their negative on-screen persona, they enjoy a huge fan following on social media, probably more than some lead actors. Some of TV’s favourite vamps tell us about the good side of playing bad.\\nKamya Punjabi has been one of the most hated women on TV, but the actress is social media’s darling\\n\\nKamya Punjabi\\nFrom Sindoora in \\'Banoo Main Teri Dulhann\\' to Preeto in \\'Shakti – Astitva Ke Ehsaas Ki\\', Kamya Punjabi has been one of the most hated women on TV.

Talking about fans’ changing perception towards TV villains, Kamya says, “During Banoo Main Teri Dulhann’s shoot, we were in Madh Island when a group of women came and tried to kill me. Pehle toh aisa lagta tha ke mehnat toh hum bhi kartein hain, hum bhi show ko utna hi time aur energy detein hain toh humare saath aise kyun hota hai. I am glad that this doesn’t happen anymore. The audience today is very smart. They might hate your character, but then they understand that it’s not who you are.\"\\nA style queen on the show, Reyhna Malhotra\\'s social media handles are equally glamorous\\n\\nReyhna Malhotra\\nIshqbaaz’s Svetlana, Reyhna Malhotra, is literally a social media diva. A style queen on the show, her social media handles are equally glamorous and send fans into a tizzy every time the actress posts a picture. Reyhna’s wall is all about glitz, glamour and setting trends. Most of her posts ace Instagram’s #OOTD #outfitgoals, #makeupgoals and #accessorygoals. “I feel super lucky to have such an amazing fan following. I always thought that positive roles are liked by more people, but now I realise, as long as I am doing my work with sincerity and happiness, it’s all good.

The restaurants promise to serve food made from organic vegetables, without adding any harmful ingredients. Hotel Nalan promises to serve food that would help a person live for 120 years.\\n“Our food ingredients are almost 99% organic. Only in cases that certain vegetables are not available from our organic suppliers, we buy it from the market,” said M Karuppusamy, who started the restaurant six years ago.\\n“Customers prefer our food because it is organic and healthy, without oil, maida, milk, sugar, tamarind or masala,” he said.\\nKaruppusamy said there has been an increase in awareness and craze towards organic food in the last two years. “Two years ago, we used to get around 100 to 150 customers a day. Today, we get 250 customers a day, and we have started a second branch in the city,” he added.\\nThe customers to such restaurants are not just old people with health problems either. Youngsters, who are believed to prefer fast food or continental food, form a large part of their clientele, say restauranteurs.\\nN Karthikeyan, who started the Iyal organic store and Iyal organic lunch two years ago, said many of his clients are young doctors who work at a nearby major hospital.\\n“I initially started this lunch to show people how different food tastes when prepared with organically grown vegetables, millets and spices,” he said. “Today, a lot of my clientele are bachelor doctors, youngsters working in offices nearby and we provide lunch to some staff at Radio Mirchi office too,” he added.\\nIn a clear indication of youngsters preferring home cooked, healthy food, Karthikeyan said his customers for lunch have grown multiple folds.\\n“Two years ago, we got one or two customers a day. Now, we get almost 20 to 25 customers for lunch,” he added.\\n“Quite a few of them are youngsters and we get good feedback about how they feel light and energetic after our meals. It is prompting us to start a lunch box concept which we can deliver to offices,” he added.\\nAsha Praveen, a young student writer, said she has organic lunch at least twice a week. “The food in Iyal, especially the millet biriyani and hand-pounded rice, is extremely tasty and I find it flavourful and energetic,” she said. “I find myself feeling more comfortable after eating it compared to eating any other cuisine,” she added.\\nVishal H, another marketing professional who tries eating at one of the organic joints in the city at least thrice a week, says he tried it for the first time three months ago with a lot of hesitation and as an experiment. “I was mentally prepared for it to taste bad or ordinary, but I found myself feeling good after the meal. I then got used to how it tastes and am almost addicted to it. I also found myself not gaining weight after it,” he said.',\n",

       " 'As always, Nivin Pauly seems like someone who is in a tearing hurry when you talk to him. Ask him about life outside work and he confines the answers to a line or two and a smile, but a mention of films and he turns articulate. It could perhaps be because the actor has back-to-back projects lined up, all big in their own way, leaving him with no time for anything else. We caught up with the elusive Nivin during a schedule break of Love Action Drama, in which he shares screen with Nayanthara.\\n\\nYou acted with Trisha in Hey Jude and now you are acting with Nayanthara!\\n\\nIt’s purely accidental (laughs). Love Action Drama was planned first. I have only a few combination scenes with Nayanthara in it, but we knew each other so everything was comfortable.\\nWhat is the film about?\\n\\nI can’t talk much about it, except that my character is a somewhat jobless person, who is supposedly running his family business. He is a bit of a trouble maker. The film is a proper entertainer, a romcom. And Dhyan (Sreenivasan) as a director is very cool. He does this homework thoroughly and has a clear idea of every scene.\\n\\nYou learnt kalari for your upcoming period film. Did you hit the gym too?\\n\\nYes, kalari is prominent in the story as the protagonist makes his escapes with its movies. However, I couldn’t learn it properly as I had to join this set straight from that of Hey Jude. Also, it’s not something which can be learnt at short notice. The original character apparently learnt it by watching it from the top of a tree and imitating the movies. There are fight sequences throughout, and I learnt whatever is required for those scenes.\\nIn those days, fighters were bulky, not musclemen. I never tried to build muscles.\\n\\nIt is your first period film as well.\\n\\nYes, so far I had only watched period films, I was never part of one. It was an entirely new experience to be on the set and be part of something of such a large scale. I was genuinely apprehensive at first, and asked the director, ‘The character goes through different stages of life and you are investing so much. Are you sure I can carry this off?’ But he had faith in me and said I was the perfect choice. His faith in me was a confidence booster.\\n\\nMohanlal being part of the film was a bit of a surprise. How was it to share scenes with him?\\n\\nMohanlal’s character is like a mentor to the protagonist. A larger-than-life persona was needed for it and we couldn’t imagine anyone else other than Lalettan for it. He was happy to be part of the film on hearing the script and was with us for 10-12 days.\\nI had only seen him outside a set and to act with him was something else altogether. I noticed several things I could learn from him, sheer professionalism, for instance. He doesn’t sit idle even for a minute. Come rain or shine, let’s work as much as possible is his mantra. That kind of fire was unbelievable. But at the same time, I was relaxed, as he would say things like, ‘Mone, take your time, why don’t you do it this way?’ etc.\\n\\nHave you ever felt that Shyamaprasad’s Hey Jude was a bit underrated?\\n\\nFor a film to reach people and to be successful, proper marketing is needed. And some films need a push more than others. I have doubts whether this was done properly with Hey Jude. We are helpless here. Also, no one expects a commercial film from Shyam sir but this was different. So yes, I feel it didn’t get the run it deserved.\\n\\nAnd then you worked with Geetu Mohandas, yet another offbeat director, for Moothon.\\n\\nShoot is over for the film, but it will be released in festivals first. Again, I can’t talk much about the film except that it’s about a child going in search of his brother. There are a lot of emotions involved and the film is all about the images he comes across and their relationship. I play the brother in the film.\\nAs for Geetu, she is brilliant as a director. She is the kind of director who gets the best out of every actor and I feel she is the best in that regard. She refines the actor in you over and over until you get inside the very soul of the character. Only a few can do that.\\n\\nYou started out as an out and out popular star, the favourite of youngsters, a romantic hero. And now you are part of Shyamprasad’s and Geetu Mohandas’ films. Is it conscious?\\n\\nI like to experiment. If I do the same thing over and over, everyone will get bored, including me. With the passage of time, we too need to change and mature. Thankfully I am getting the right kinds of movies at the right time. I consider it a blessing.\\n\\nIt’s been exactly eight years since your first film, Malarvady Art’s Club released. How do you see your evolution as an actor?\\n\\nI don’t know if I have evolved but I’m sure that there are a lot of areas where I need to improve. The last year has been about such realisations. I should be more professional. The next step is to implement whatever I learnt.\\nThe only thing we can do is to keep learning, keep identifying our weaknesses and work on them. But I have never regretted my choice of films. Regardless of successes and failures, I have always chosen projects which I happily took up. Even if there wasn’t a theatrical success, a film would have helped us in some way. As an actor you might have learnt something, or you would have cultivated some good relationships. That’s equally important.\\n\\nAmong the top male stars, you are probably the only one without a family background in cinema.\\n\\nThat’s something which is always on my mind, but it has only made me work harder. It used to be a source of stress earlier but now I have friends in the industry — directors and producers — who I know will be with me come what may. But still, it acts a as wake-up call whenever I feel lazy.\\nI always get messages from youngsters saying I am an inspiration for them. Perhaps I am proof that if your desire is strong enough and your mind is firmly set mind on something, nothing is possible. I hope I could help them realise that hard work pays.\\n\\nYour parents worked in Switzerland during your childhood. When did the film bug catch you?\\n\\nYes, my sister and I stayed with our dad’s brother in Aluva during childhood. The summer vacations were the only time we got to meet our parents in Switzerland and we would wait eagerly for it.\\nTo be honest I don’t know when I started thinking of films as a career. I was never crazy about films though I liked to watch them. My dream was always to become a businessman. But cinema was always on my mind and at one point, it all just fell into place and slowly I entered the mainstream.\\nIt was always about acting for me, though. All other roles in the industry seem too difficult for me.\\n\\nSo what, in your view, is that one thing an actor needs to make it big in films?\\n\\nDo your job well, with maximum commitment, make good choices. You might be tempted to take up a film for many not-so-good reasons, money among others. The key is to not lose track of your career by giving in to these temptations. That applies to every field, of course. So the key, I’d say, is to not compromise on your career for anything; permanent things should not be sacrificed for temporary benefits. Then of course, you should have luck in your favour.\\n\\nWhat next in films?\\n\\nI have Mikhael by Haneef Adani coming up. It’s a family thriller. We are still discussing the content.\\n\\n\\nYou have kept away from all the discussions regarding the controversial AMMA meeting, and the subsequent events.\\n\\nI am a member of AMMA, and I attend their meetings. Being a member, I abide by the decisions of the office bearers. I believe they are taking the right decisions. I am not in the executive committee, so I don’t think I should have any further opinions here.\\n\\n\\nHave you ever felt the need to take a stand about something you feel is right, being a young, successful actor with influence over youngsters?\\n\\nEveryone has their versions of right and wrong. I too have them. If there comes an extreme situation where I have to state my views, I will. But not now.',\n",

       " 'Late director-cinematographer Jeeva’s assistant, KC Sundaram is all set to make his directorial debut this year. Titled July Kaatrile, this film stars Premam fame Ananth Nag, Chennai To Singapore actress Anju Kurian and Malayalam actress Samyuktha Menon in the lead. He says, “The film takes on relationships in today’s time. There are only a few genres in Kollywood, and romance is one of them. But I’ve approached storytelling in a different manner.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSundaram adds that the biggest highlight of the film is that its story is relatable. “The relationship tale that’s narrated could have happened to the audience themselves, or to their friends. But, this concept has not been explored in cinema before,” he says.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe film has been shot in Chennai, Kothagiri and Sri Lanka, and a song has been filmed in Portugal. “Sathish also plays a pivotal role in the film. Music is by Joshua Sridhar. We will be releasing a single from the film next week,” he informs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAsk Sundaram about his association with Jeeva, and he says, “I was working with Jeeva sir for a very long time. After he passed away, I was involved in writing scripts, and I’m happy this film has materialised. Actually, Jeeva sir’s Unnale Unnale was initially titled July Kaatrile. After writing this script, I felt the title would be apt for my film.”',\n",

       " 'When Nidhi Kushalappa was shooting for her Kannada film Preethi Prema, she chanced upon a poster of the then just-released Telugu movie, Kumari 21F, which intrigued her. “There was something about it that really drew me to it and I wished that some day I would get a film like that to be a part of. And just about six months later, I was elated when I got the offer to be a part of the Kannada remake,” says Nidhi. When director Sriman Vemula spoke to her, he told Nidhi that there would be fair share of intimate scenes and smoking. “So, I went back home and watched the original again, and what I liked about the character I was offered was that she is actually quite innocent, not someone who is always smoking and drinking. In fact, she tries smoking and drinking in the course of the narrative, then falls in love, which is also when she kisses a guy — all of this for the first time. The fact that she is rather innocent, yet explorative, in nature, drew me to the character. Also, the movie tries to project that as a girl, you need to be what you want to be, without bowing to societal diktats,” says Nidhi.\\n\\nIn the film, Nidhi plays a model, who falls in love with Pranam Devaraj’s character, a small town guy who is easily swayed by what his friends tell him about their perception of her. “His friends tell him that I am not a good girl and that I was the sort of woman who would roam around with different guys. What they don’t realise is that these are people who drop her back home after a late shoot. So, he misunderstands my character and asks her about it, to which she tells him that she cannot change herself because of his insecurity. I relate to the character, especially since people tend to think that those in the film industry have questionable morals. I believe that people shouldn’t judge women based on what she does, says or wears and that is the message in Kumari 21F as well. You need to love her for who and what she is,” asserts Nidhi.\\n\\nDespite all this, the actress says that the film is not a heroine-centric tale. “There is a social message and, hence the title, but Kumari 21F is as much about Pranam’s character as it is about mine,” says Nidhi. But given that she has done ‘bold’ scenes in the film, is the actress worried about being typecast in the industry? “I don’t think that holds true anymore. Similar roles could come my way, but it depends on what I take up next,” she signs off.',\n",

But she couldn’t be happier that things turned out the way they did and that she got to star in Katheyondu Shuruvagide. Ahead of the release of the film this Friday, Pooja tells us about all the fun the team had on the set and more…\\nTHE RAKSHIT SHETTY CONNECT\\nI had met Rakshit (Shetty, producer) during the promotion of one of my Tamil movies. I had watched Lucia, Ulidavaru Kandanthe and U Turn, and wanted to work in Kannada films. I had told him to keep me informed if he knew of any interesting Kannada movies. That opportunity came to me two years later with Katheyondu Shuruvagide.\\n\\n\\n‘EVERY HEROINE WOULD WANT TO DO A FILM LIKE THIS’ I was very happy when I heard the script of the movie.

In fact, the entire team was fun to hang out with. Diganth is my male version and we connected over sports.

       " 'Months of hard work and preparation have finally paid off for 10 girls from Bengaluru, who will represent the country at the Jr. NBA World Championship to be held in Orlando, Florida, US, this month. The girls will fight it out in the Under-14 category and will compete against some of the best teams from across the world. The excited and lively bunch was at the Bangalore Times office recently, during which they spoke at length about their love for the game and their cheat day meals, among others. The team comprises Vedaa Anand, Shreya Ashok, Nuha Asif Masood, Shreya Bose, Sunishka Kartik, Diya Kothari, Meghana Manjunatha, Moumita Mishra, Hamsa Nanjundaiah and Smriti Vemula, while Prasanna Venkatesh Rajamanickam is the head coach.\\nExcited to represent the country at a global stage\\nThe girls are excited to represent India at the championship. “We are very happy and proud of ourselves because we are getting a chance to represent our country. We won’t let India down,” says Moumita. Sunishka adds, “It’s a big stage for us and we’re hoping to use this to take our dreams forward. We want to build a name for India in the field of basketball. A lot of people are living their dreams through us and we want to make a mark.”\\n\\n\\nBasketball is their life On a daily basis, the team puts in at least four hours of practice and they don’t mind waking up at the break of dawn just to be able to play their favourite sport. “We don’t mind waking up really early for basketball and four hours is nothing. We can easily put in more hours of practice,” says Moumita. Do they have to follow a strict diet? “We do, but most often, we don’t follow it” laughs Sunishka, adding that they have to avoid junk and fried food. “But we have our cheat day meals, which is almost every day,” says Moumita.\\n\\nOn asking what drew them to the sport, Diya says, “The game is not just about one person, it is a team effort. Each and every person, both on and off court contributes to the game.” Nuha adds that it is the team spirit that drew them to the game. The team has been working extremely hard over the past few months and has been doing their best, says their coach. “The girls have put in a lot of effort and are working extremely hard,” says Prasanna, adding that the team practices daily for many hours working on their skills. “They are as good as any other international team and are very passionate and hardworking,” says Prasanna.\\n\\n\\nNeed more involvement from other states\\n\\nWhen asked about what are their thoughts on the current basketball scene in India, the team says the sport needs more support, especially in the rural areas of the country. Smriti says, “It’s a great start but we need more involvement from other states as well. Basketball needs more support on a larger scale, so that there are more girls from every background participating in the sport.”\\n\\nThe girls hope to be the trendsetters for others. “During the nationals, the boys’ teams outnumbered the girls’. Some states don’t send a girls team for the competition,” says Sunishka. The girls agree that there is a lot of talent in the country and are hopeful that in the future there will be more participation from girls.\\n\\n\\nBengaluru is a great place for basketball\\n\\nThe team says that Bengaluru is a good place for basketball players. “There’s a basketball, a court and a coach, that’s all we need,” says Moumita. However, their coach says that the city is doing extremely well when it comes to promoting sports. “Bengaluru has very good facilities for basketball. A lot of colleges too have indoor courts and certified coaches,” he says. But there needs to be more support and encouragement from parents and educational institutions. “Parents need to be supportive and must encourage girls to participate in such sports. Only then, we will see the game reach greater heights in the country,” Prasanna sums up.',\n",

       " 'Gujarati and Marathi film industries have seen a stout growth in the last two decades. It’s evidenced in their box office numbers which are booming and the sheer number of films that are being made in both the industries every year. Lower budgets and the incentives from the state governments of Maharashtra and Gujarat have propelled filmmakers in these two industries to show the courage to narrate offbeat and unconventional stories with a distinctly different treatment for each. However, what might come as a surprise to many is that the ratio of hits and flops is one is to 20 or more.\\nThe idea behind the discussion, ‘Between The Hits’, conducted at the 5th Indian Screenwriters Conference in Mumbai on August 1, was to understand the silences between the hits in cinema from both the languages and to seek a breakthrough in the given scenario. Ketki Pandit, the former head of the department of FTII’s Department of Screenplay Writing, moderated the discussion. A playwright herself, she will soon direct a feature film of her own.\\nThe panel comprised Nikhil Sane, the business head of Viacom 18 (Marathi Film Division) who has backed films like ‘Sairat’, Katyar Kaljat Ghusli’, ‘Natasamrat’, ‘Fandry’, ‘Killa’ and ‘Lai Bhaari’ to name a few, director Ravi Jadhav who has directed ‘Natrang’ and ‘Nude’, Manaswini LR, a successful writer whose films include ‘Kachcha Limbu’, ‘Ti Sadhya Kay Karte’ and the TV series ‘Ek Lagnachi Dusri Gosht’ and writer-producer-director Abhishek Jain who has helmed Gujarati films like ‘Kevi Rite Jaaish’ and ‘Bey Yaar’.\\nThe dialogue between the panellists and the moderator navigated through various subjects. While the brave storylines attempted in the Marathi and Gujarati films were applauded, it was pointed out and agreed upon that the writing department lacks the technical understanding of their craft which can be honed through periodic workshops. Regional cinema has the bandwidth for exceptionally different stories and screenplays but what mars them is the exigencies of exhibition and distribution. The panel discussed the fact that Gujarati and Marathi films face stiff competition from Hollywood and Bollywood films.\\nWhile Nikhil Sane drew the attention of the listeners to the ever-expanding box office collections of Marathi films, an area in which ‘Sairat’ is considered exemplary, Abhishek Jain brought to light the fact that the audience for Gujarati films has also in a manner stopped seeking films based on mythology alone. They have begun to show keen interest in younger and more relatable, brave stories – some of which are the kind that Hindi films shy away from.',\n",

       " 'Chakras manage our physical, metaphysical and practical well-being. If our chakras are out of order or if they are not aligned, they might create problems. ‘Chakras’ is a universal phenomenon with more than 100 chakras associated with each individual but the most vital of them are the seven chakras located in the body. The word comes from the Sanskrit ‘cakra’ meaning a wheel or a circle. While there are various techniques to get the chakras right like aroma therapy, reiki, crystals etc., it is also easy to practice it on yourself once you learn how to do it on your own. Balance chakras on your own\\nAll human beings are born with these energy centres, and balancing and activating them correctly is important. Psychologist and performance coach Dr Kanan Khatau Chikhal teaches people who want to learn on how to heal themselves with chakra balancing. She says, “Your chakras need to be balanced everyday and you can choose any one methodology to do so. These include visualisation experiences, colour therapy, chanting and stretches. Those who are very dominating will face acidity issues while those who cannot express themselves will have throat issues. Achieving a balance can help your physical and emotional well-being since it is an interface between the two.”\\n\\nYou can work on them daily\\nKanan encourages individuals to practice chakra balancing daily. “It takes just five minutes and you can choose the technique as per the need of the chakra. If you’re feeling emotional you can choose sound therapy and when you are stressed, your body will automatically choose stretches. Likewise, each chakra is related to a particular colour and visualising that shade or painting that colour also helps you balance that chakra. Since the chakras are connected with physical organs, you even come to know how it impacts your child’s life. The child’s physical health becomes a litmus test for you to check your parenting style.”\\n\\nIt is good for physical and emotional well-being\\nChakra balancing is used for the purpose of holistic healing and self-awareness. Clinical psychologist Namrata Dagia, who helps people balance their chakras says, “Healing transforms negative energy into positive energy and as time passes, it also helps the mental and physical well-being of the individual.” The problems get resolved at a quicker pace but we are also clear that they work hand-in-hand with regular medications. That is the reason we take their medical history and then plan, since chakra healing is an add-on healing process. While we take care of the physical aspects of the chakra, we touch base on all chakras by using different techniques to go to the root cause and then find the core emotional reasons. So, it simultaneously takes care of both the issues since each chakra resonates to a particular emotional factor.”',\n",

Though she keeps coming to the city for events, she has only managed to see some parts of the capital. The former 'Bigg Boss' contestant was recently in Delhi to promote her show 'Nazar' and accompanied us to the Humayun’s Tomb where she couldn’t stop gushing about the beauty of the monument. “This is so beautiful! I would love to bring my family here so that they can also see the beauty of the monument.

Whenever I come here, shopping toh must hai hi, aur uske liye Sarojini Nagar bahut baar gayi hoon. I think the fashion sense of people in Delhi is completely different from other places,” she said.\\n\\n\\nMona Lisa\\n\\n‘Viewers like to watch supernatural shows’\\n\\nThis is the first time Mona is doing a negative role and is quite excited to play a daayan in 'Nazar'. “I was very happy when I was offered this role because I have never played a negative character before.

I believe in the supernatural in real life as well.

       " \"From fighting trolls online and making headlines on news hour debates to launching a nation-wide survey, filmmaker Anubhav Sinha is gearing for the release of his courtroom drama 'Mulk' this Friday. Backed by a robust storyline and an ensemble cast, the film, produced by Soham Rockstar Entertainment and Benaras Media Works, deals with Islamophobia. Pegged as a commercial film that doesn’t have the usual trappings of mainstream cinema, 'Mulk' delivers a though-provoking narrative on extremist socio-political behaviour and how lack of literacy has damaged the social fabric of the nation.\\n\\nWriter-director Anubhav Sinha states, “It is an imperative film for the turbulent times we live in. What inspired me is that I am familiar with both sides of the story. Hindu-Muslim riots were an annual event from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. I was in Benaras then and belonged to the majority. Thereafter, I went to Aligarh Muslim University to study engineering, but this time I was a minority. I have seen the divide between both the sides and have a take on it, which I put together for 'Mulk' using cinematic liberties. I have always had this impression that a majority of people do not want a confrontation. Everything that you are concerned about as a Muslim and everything that I am concerned about as a Hindu, I have tried to touch upon.”\\n\\n\\nDeepak Mukut, who is producing the film, adds, “With this film, Anubhav questions polarities and communities and our premise is that no politician or government can eliminate the deep distrust in our society, until each of us changes individually.”\\n\\nInspired by certain news headlines over the years, where a Muslim family is trying to reclaim its honour, the film stars Rishi Kapoor, Taapsee Pannu, Prateik Babbar, Manoj Pahwa, Neena Gupta, Rajat Kapoor, Ashutosh Rana, Prachee Shah Paandya in pivotal roles.\\n\\n\\n'Mulk' releases on August 3.\",\n",

       " 'Mithila Palkar is India’s bona fide digital star and the actress will soon be seen in ‘Karwaan’ alongside Irrfan and Dulquer Salmaan. In a chat with BT, Mithila talks about wanting to be an actor since she was 12, how she bagged ‘Karwaan’, and why she doesn’t want to be a star who is unapproachable.\\n‘Karwaan’ is your third film, but you have already featured in ‘Katti Batti’ (2015) and the Marathi film ‘Muramba’(2017). Did you always want to become an actor?\\n\\nI always knew that I wanted to be an actor. I made my debut on stage when I was 12 and I was sure that this is what made me happy. However, nobody takes a 12-year-old’s career choice seriously. Everybody laughed it off. I also ran away from it, but acting eventually found me.\\nGrowing up in Mumbai, what were the influences that propelled you towards taking up acting as a career?\\n\\nTheatre and cinema have been major influences in my life. Initially, I wanted to do Marathi theatre because Marathi is my mother tongue and there was a certain comfort level. I have grown up watching plays at Shivaji Mandir and used to participate in plays in school, too. Like a lot of people, I also grew up watching Bollywood films.\\n\\nTraditionally, getting an opportunity to be a part of a film is considered a huge struggle. Were you ever plagued by such thoughts?\\n\\nI knew I would turn to films at some point, but I didn’t approach the profession thinking that I want to play the lead in a film. I wanted to be an actor and I didn’t know how to go about making a career. I experimented with whatever opportunity came my way. When I got the chance to work in shows on the internet, I jumped right into it. I want to be part of good content and it doesn’t matter where it is being showcased.\\n\\nHow did you bag the role in Karwaan?\\n\\nI was working with a theatre company that organises a youth theatre festival called Thespo. Both Akarsh (Khurana, director of ‘Karwaan’) and I are Thespo alumnis. He told me that he was making a film and that he was going to suggest my name to Nandini Shrikent, the casting director. After the audition and look test, I had to wait for a long time. I thought it wouldn’t work out. I was really looking forward to it because who wouldn’t want work with two of the finest actors in the country, Irrfan and Dulquer Salmaan. But thankfully, it worked out. They are effortless and spontaneous.\\n\\nDoes it feel strange that you are not promoting the film with Irrfan?\\n\\nIt feels incomplete. Not a day goes by without Dulquer and I talking about Irrfan’s absence during promotions. He brings a different kind of energy to the table and we miss that a lot.\\n\\nWho do you turn to for advice when you are choosing films?\\n\\nQuasar Padamsee and Toral Shah are my mentors and strongest pillars of support. I have been fortunate enough to meet a lot of people who have helped me. Akarsh, too, has been very supportive through the film because it is daunting to share screen space with Irrfan and Dulquer Salmaan.\\n\\n\\nIn showbiz, celebrities are always expected to look good and are constantly papped. Are you prepared for such scrutiny?\\n\\n\\nI live in Dadar with my grandparents. I think they will keep me grounded. I will still be getting ‘kadi patta’ for them from the market. Home gives me a reality check.\\n\\n\\nWhat do you think your fans like about you the most?\\n\\n\\nI think the game changes when the wall between you and the viewer breaks. For the viewers, I think I come across as relatable. I don’t want to be put up on a pedestal because stars are worshipped in our country. I definitely want to be successful. I always want to be approachable. But I also feel the internet has changed that. I like the fact that you can write to Shah Rukh Khan and he might just reply back to you.',\n",

       " 'Over 130 principals, teachers and counsellors from across the city got together to discuss one of the most poignant topics of the current educational scenario — student suicides\\nThe suicide of a child leaves a school with grieving students, distressed families and school staff, unwarranted, unwanted media attention and a community struggling to understand what went wrong and why. In situations like these, a school needs reliable information, practical tools and guidance to help protect its students.\\n\\nAnd keeping that in mind, over 130 principals, vice principals, institution heads, senior teachers, counsellors of schools and colleges from across Mumbai got together at the ‘Prevent Suicide, Save Life’ event, to discuss how to deal with and prevent student suicides.\\n“The focus at the event was to build an emergency response team within schools, develop alliances between schools, professionals and communities. To share best practices and devise a systemic approach in making a difference,” explains Pratima Bhandarkar, head of the counselling centre at a school in Powai.\\n\\nWith suicide rates at an all-time high, this meet topped the priority list of school authorities. Not many are aware that globally, suicide is counted as the top five causes of death among teenagers. The participants discussed ways that could be implemented to prevent and deal with the situation.\\n\\nMultipronged approach\\nPsychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty, who has been working for a while with school authorities in this field, believes that appropriate dissemination of information, raising awareness levels, and regular suicide prevention programmes are just a few factors that can help bring about a change.\\n\\n“Having said that, just like a doctor can’t save or prevent every single heart attack, we cannot stop or prevent every single suicide,” says Dr Shetty adding, “However, suicide prevention is feasible. And it involves multiple activities right from best conditions to bring up kids and youth, effective treatment of mental disorders, environmental control of all kinds of risk factors are important.” Counsellor Natasha Mehra adds, “Connecting to a child as a human being without the agenda of being a principal, teacher, counsellor or parent is important.”\\n\\nSpending quality time\\nSheela Mallya, principal of a school in Kandivli, has seen children craving for someone to confide in. In today’s fast-paced lives with working parents and nuclear families, most kids go back to empty homes, microwave their food, eat alone, and then go off to tuition.\\n\\nSheela says, “Children are looking for someone who is will listen to them. So, we have evolved a system where we make sure quality time is spent with the children. Every week, one hour is used to just have candid conversations with kids. Teachers are trained to get children to speak and not to show reactions but to just listen compassionately. In the bargain, kids learn that they are not the only ones who have issues — everyone has problems and that is comforting.”\\n\\nTimely intervention\\nSome teachers feel that today’s children are privileged and entitled and when faced with a situation that is not to their liking, they are unable to handle it. Armaity Engineer, principal of a school in Juhu says, “We are an inclusive school, with a child-friendly board and have kids with special needs. We did have a case where 16 suicide attempts were made by a brilliant child but the child did not commit suicide. That was because of our intervention — his absenteeism made us aware of the issue. We have a highly functioning counselling section and our teachers are trained to handle cases too.”\\n\\nSchools must have many counsellors\\nRanjini Krishnaswamy, who has been a principal for over 25 years, says, “We need a battery of counsellors in every school. It’s okay if the school does not have an AC, but it must have a counsellor. Constant training workshops are another must for teachers in every school in order to sensitise them to children’s needs.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSelf-preservation lessons\\nRecently, a student from a suburban school was found flaunting cuts on her wrists. Psychiatrists explained that in such cases, sensitivity is essential. “These days kids flaunt cuts. Talk to the kid, don’t preach. Teach them self-preservation; cutting shouldn’t be ignored,” said Dr Shetty.\\n\\nThere are instances when none of the so-called symptoms of ‘suicidal’ tendencies are visible in a child. Dr Shetty advises, “Emotional equity building among kids is essential. Teachers should share emotions with kids. Whatever the school tells students can have a phenomenal impact.”\\n\\n\\nTry these apps\\n\\nThere are some apps that can help in suicide prevention. Sonali Patankar, who has been working on responsible netism and cyber wellness says, “Apps like Semi Colon, Break Free - Digital, Stay Alive, Quality Time, Freedom.to, Stay Focussed etc, can help you deal with screen addiction and digital detox.” She adds, “Some apps however, are only applicable if you have your sensibilities in mind and have conditioned yourself. That’s why parental monitoring is essential.” Experts say that the escalation of suicide attempts have increased with the easy availability of dating apps. “These dating apps are meant for adults. We have found that kids as young as 10 have them. A 17-year-old used Tinder and met many guys. And after all that she became depressed and is now suicidal.” Parents must monitor screen time of kids.” shares Dr Shetty.\\n\\n\\n\\nListen to you child\\n\\nCounsellor Sushreeta Sule says, “Students respond to a ‘Hey, how’re you doing?’, ‘What’s up’, very well. These chhoti baatein often lead to big stuff. We can pick up verbal and non-verbal cues about discomfort and unrest from these little queries. The three prominent problems in kids are lack of acceptance, lack of emotional communication and disconnect.”',\n",

       " 'So, you’ve flaunted all your pretty vibrant clothes during the summer and it is that time of the year when gumboots, umbrellas and waterproof make-up need to come out of your wardrobe. Although monsoon brings out the pensive artists in us, dressing up in this season can be a tricky task as the roads get dirtier, leaving your clothes in a deplorable condition. BT compiles a list of fashion mistakes you must avoid when it starts to rain cats and dogs. Read on...\\nStay away from leather\\n\\nNo doubt that leather shoes and handbags make great style statements but in this weather, they could catch fungus and lose their sheen. Sporting the leather look in monsoon is a Himalayan blunder you do not want to make. “Please stock away any leather products you own in a clean dry place till the season is over,” says celebrity stylist Mohit Rai.\\nAvoid wearing white\\n\\n“Unless you’re looking for a sheer moment in your day, avoid light colours, especially white, in case you end up getting wet in the rain,” adds Mohit. This colour not only makes mud stains all the more visible, white (across all fabrics) tends to reveal a lot more than you would like to when it rains heavily and you are drenched.\\n\\nMake-up that screams for attention\\n\\nMonsoon make-up is a tricky business not many know how to master. While a tinge of (dewy) make-up adds a dash of glam to your otherwise dull day, a little caution is required when you apply make-up. “Non waterproof make-up is completely a no-no. You don’t want to get wet and have mascara and eye-liner smudging all over your face. As much as possible, wear very minimal day make-up and preferably nothing that could smudge and leave a stain. Just keep it as waterproof and light as possible,” says celebrity stylist Eshaa Amiin.\\n\\nNothing too flashy\\n\\nStatement neckpieces and chunky earrings look great with any outfit and up your glam quotient but with the moisture levels going high during monsoon, it is best to avoid wearing anything that hurts the eyes. For one, they rust and lead to skin allergies and two; no one ever looked like a million bucks teaming chunky jewellery with raincoats and gumboots. Simple studs and a chain with a small pendant is all that you need in this season.\\n\\nSay no to heels\\n\\nUnless you are attending a wedding or a really formal event and must wear heels, avoid them at all costs. You may be wearing a knockout outfit and sporting the perfect make-up, but if you walk down the road wearing sky-high heels, you are at a risk of tripping over and ruining your expensive shoes. Flip-flops, jelly shoes, ankle strap sandals and, of course, gumboots are some of the options that should be considered when it rains heavily.\\n\\n\\nClingy fabrics are a big no-no\\n\\n\\nThin and light fabrics that are too clingy are a big no-no in this season. That pretty, free-flowing dress you have wanted to wear for quite some time needs to wait because when it starts to pour incessantly, the dress will stick to your body and make it awkward for you. Synthetic fabrics are also avoidable this season since they take ages to dry. Cotton or any other form of soft fabric should be your go-to material this monsoon.\\n\\n\\nKeep away from long, artistry sleeves\\n\\n\\nBell sleeve or full sleeve tops may save you from the windy weather but tend to get wet easily and take ages to dry. If you are on the go, stick to half and mid-length sleeved garments. Or if you can carry them off, wear sleeveless tops preferably in vibrant hues to cheer yourself up during dark, gloomy days. Also, high-low dresses and tops need to be used during summer and not in the monsoon for the simple fact that they get dirty way too easily and spoil your near-perfect look.',\n",

       " \"Hyderabad: A Hyderabadi turned member of British Parliament and chairman of Cobra Beer, Lord Karan Bilimoria wants to brew beer in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. In an exclusive interview with TOI over email, Bilimoria reminisced about growing up in his ancestral mansion ‘Anand Bhavan’ in West Marredpally, his days in Hyderabad Public School (HPS) and what he finds wrong with the UK immigration policy. Excerpts:\\nSecunderabad, played an interesting role in your life. What are the recollections from the West Marredpally days at your ancestral home ‘Anand Bhavan’ which was recently sold?\\nAnand Bhavan was my first home, from birth in Hyderabad. My father was an Indian army officer and we would often be with him, but every two or three years he would be posted to non-family stations and Anand Bhavan was base for myself, my mother and my brother. My childhood memories in Anand Bhavan were of a large household, with many dogs! We were surrounded by beautiful fields, where we kept a herd of cows and had fresh milk every day. There were orchards and a large vegetable garden, and we could see the Secunderabad Club from the back of the house in those days. It was a happy home run by my maternal grandmother, Aimai.\\nDid you brew the idea to dabble in beer business in Secunderabad?\\nI always wanted to manufacture Cobra in Hyderabad and for two periods in our company’s history we manufactured at Crown Breweries just outside Hyderabad. While there we produced excellent quality Cobra Beer, which was very well-liked and appreciated. Unfortunately, for commercial reasons it was unviable, and we had to stop production in the state. I do hope we get the opportunity to produce Cobra in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in the future.\\nCan you recall memorable moments in your days in HPS…\\nI really enjoyed my time at the Hyderabad Public School and many of my contemporaries from there remain my close friends to this day. The school was made up of beautiful buildings and large grounds where not only did we have excellent academic teaching, but lots of extra-curricular activities and sports. One abiding memory was that we had to train as cadets for the annual school speech day, and we had to march in precision. I remember one year the chief guest was the Nizam of Hyderabad, who was a classmate of my father’s at the Doon School.\\nIs it true that your father Mr Faridoon Bilimoria named you 'Karan' after former Rajya Sabha MP and former J&K governor Karan Singh?\\nIt was at the Doon School that my father met Dr Karan Singh and I was indeed named after him, something he reminds me about each time I see him! Karan is also in fact a Parsi name, albeit a rare one!\\nParsis, like tigers, are rapidly dwindling. There are only 60,000 Parsis in India in a population of over 1 billion. In Hyderabad, the city you were born, the number is slightly over 1,000. The tiger numbers have improved after ‘Project Tiger’, we now have ‘Jiyo Parsi’ scheme. Are you hopeful, concerned?\\nThe Zoroastrian Parsi community is a tiny community of refugees from Persia, going back over 1000 years. They have made a remarkable impact in India in virtually every field and profession. Unfortunately, the Parsi community has been dwindling, one reason being that lineage runs paternally, so women who marry outside the community – which many nowadays do – cannot initiate their children into the religion. With this rule existing, this will naturally lead to a decline in the Parsi community. Parsi families are also becoming smaller. My mother was one of four children, her mother was one of four sisters and her father one of nine children. I have four children, and so I am doing the best to make up the numbers! My familial ancestry is a manifestation of the remarkable achievements of the tiny Zoroastrian Parsi community in India – a community which I say has the highest achievement rate per capita of any in the world, with only 59,000 Parsi remaining in India out of a population of 1.25 billion.\\nWould Cobra be getting into craft beer considering its growing popularity in the UK, US and Europe? Will Cobra change its craft?\\nCobra doesn’t need to change because actually it is in fact itself the ultimate craft beer. We were well ahead of the times! Our entire range is in this mould. We have created King Cobra, the world’s first double-fermented lager with an ale yeast, manufactured in Belgium, and winner of several gkrand gold medals. We have created a Cobra non-alcoholic beer, Cobra Zero, and we are just introducing Gluten Free Cobra. Cobra Malabar Blond IPA small batch series is also the perfect craft beer.\\nHow do you see India as a marketplace?\\nIndia has the potential to be one of the two largest beer markets in the world, along with China which over the past couple of decades overtook the US to become the largest.\\nThe clampdown on immigration in the UK and the US is hurting the Indian students and IT professionals. As an immigrant, does the growing protectionism hurt you then?\\nI led a debate a few years ago in the House of Lords on the contribution of ethnic and religious minorities to the economy and culture of the UK. Britain, with less than 1% of the world’s population and with its empire long behind it, is still the fifth largest economy in the world. This would not have been possible without the contribution of immigrants, who make up 14% of Britain’s population. The Indian diaspora in the UK is 1.5 million strong and is by far the most successful ethnic minority in Britain.\\nHowever, for the past few years the UK has had a hostile attitude to immigration. There is a target to reduce net migration to under 100,000. Yet international students are categorised as immigrants and included in these figures. This sends out the wrong perception, as in reality only 5% of these students stay in Britain, the vast majority return to their countries of origin.\\nHow do you see the India today to the India you left as a teenager? How do you see the UK you went to when you were 19 and the UK today?\\nThe India that I was brought up in as a child in the 1960s and ‘70s was an inward looking, closed country going nowhere economically. It had no respect in the world as an economy and the consumer was starved of choice. Since India’s liberalisation in 1991, it has continued to open up, and is now not only the fastest growing major economy in the whole world, but an emerging global economic superpower. It is predicted that within the next three decades, India will be one of the two largest economies in the world – along with China. Similarly, the UK that I came to as a student in the early 1980s was looked upon as a country that once had a great empire but had become a loser going nowhere.\",\n",

       " 'Farah Khan is one of the goofiest celebrities in Bollywood. Not only does she share an excellent rapport with most of the Hindi cinema fraternity members, but also keeps her social life active by engaging with fans through social media.\\n\\nRecently, Farah Khan shared a candid throwback picture with Karan Johar and Tabu in the frame. While everyone knows and is proud of Karan Johar weight loss journey and the incredible transformation as one of the most fashionable men in Bollywood, this picture dates back to the time which left even KJo quite embarrassed.\\n\\n\\nFarah captioned the picture quirkily as, “Some flashback this is!! @tabutiful clearly not liking @karanjohar in this avatar 😂n i was trying to make velvet rock in the 90’s🙈”\\n\\n\\nTake a look!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo this Karan and Tabu too replied with their thoughts about the picture, and Karan’s embarrassment towards his appearance back then is quite hilarious.
